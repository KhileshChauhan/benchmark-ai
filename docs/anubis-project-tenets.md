# Our Tenets

These are the general principles that guide the work that we do on the team.  All of our decisions will are biased in the direction of our tenets.


1. **Enabling “Self Service”** -
    The tools we build and the solutions that we create must empower our users.  We teach people how to fish... Better yet, we give them the best fishing rod that allows them to fish in the most productive way!
2. **“Push Button” Solutions with robust results** -
    Our solutions are made as simple as possible.  We exceed our end-users expectations with the output from our systems. (*invent and simplify)*
3. **Complete Delivery** -
    Our solutions are well packaged and complete; including well produced and rich documentation. (Single document origin point, Clear explanations, helpful images, well sectioned prose, etc.)
4. **Clear Mental Model (Transparency)** -
    Our solutions are designed to provide the end user with a clear mental model of what is happening in the system such that the client can effectively use and provide feedback for our products.

5. **We use tools that are best of breed with significant mind share.** -
    We build our solutions with tools (and libraries) that give the most flexibility and access to the largest possible audience.
