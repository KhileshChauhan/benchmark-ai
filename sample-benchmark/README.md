## Example benchmark

This example is based on the benchmarking code found at the [deeplearning-benchmark repo](https://github.com/awslabs/deeplearning-benchmark/tree/master/image_classification). 

The script downloads training data before running the benchmark, and results are printed to stdout. 

The docker image built from this code can be pulled running

```
docker pull jlcont/benchmarking
```
